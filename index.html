        <p1 class="Main"> This bill enstates that the death penalty shall be reinstated for certain crimes. <br>
           This is becuase it would provide the best punishment for murderers it would also <br>
           provide closure for the familes of the murdered. It would also be encouragement <br>
           to not commit murders and similarly horrible crimes. This bill will come into <br>
           practice on Tuesday, 22/11/22.

        <br>
        <p1 class="Extra"> This paragraph adds some more detail so that you can better comprehend<br>
        what this will mean for society. First of all, the crimes which are considered<br>
        'Capital Felonies', according to wikipedia, these are the crimes considered <br>
        Capital Felonies:  "crimes against the person such as murder, mass murder, <br>
        aggravated cases of rape (often including child sexual abuse), terrorism,<br>
        aircraft hijacking, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, along with<br>
        crimes against thestate such as attempting to overthrow government, treason,<br>
        espionage, sedition, and piracy, among other crimes. Also, in some cases, acts of<br>
        recidivism, aggravated robbery, and kidnapping, in addition to drug trafficking, drug<br>
        dealing, and drug possession, are capital crimes or enhancements."</p1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p1 class="Extra"> Another person/group of people who agrees with this bill is Santa Clara University.<br>
          They, for the same reason as us, think that it is more moral, because it provides peace of <br>
          mind to the families of victims. This bill is all about morality.</p1>
