        <p1 class="Main"> This bill enstates that the death penalty shall be reinstated for certain crimes. <br>
           This is becuase it would provide the best punishment for murderers it would also <br>
           provide closure for the familes of the murdered. It would also be encouragement <br>
           to not commit murders and similarly horrible crimes. This bill will come into <br>
           practice on Tuesday, 22/11/22.
